# Module 12 - Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
In this challenge identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Analysis Javascript with D3
1. In Anaconda, open the command prompt, change the directory to where the application exists (D:\Data_Visualization_and_Analytics_Boot_Camp\12_Challenge)
2. A simple web server was created running this command in Anaconda: python -m http.server
3. The application was then available from: http://localhost:8000/index.html
